My name is Ieuan Edmonds, I am 24 years old and grew up in Pembrokeshire South West Wales (the most beautiful part of the UK) with my incredible family. I grew up in an extremely active household where we spent our free time out moutain biking, surfing, coasteering and generally enjoying being outside. I also used to swim and compete for my local club. 

After finishing high school I decided to take a gap year, which turned into three. During this period I did a number of incredible things:
- Ski season. I completed a ski season in Tignes, France, where I was a chalet supervisor looking after 5 chalets, their hosts and up to 70 guests at a time. This role was incredible as it allowed me to ski almost everyday and really enjoy mountain life. 
- Yachtmaster. Following my ski season I decided to complete the yachtmaster sailing qualification over 6 months on the Isle of Wight in the UK. This qualification honed my sailing skills and allows me to legally captain a 200ton yacht with paying guests.
- Superyacht work. After completing the yachtmaster I got a job on board a 74 meter private motor yacht, called M/Y New Secret,  as a deckhand. This was an amazing experience and allowed me to travel to amazing locations and see things from a truly unique view whilst working and earing a great salary. 

Once I had spent a year on the superyacht I found that I wasnt being mentally stimulated enough and found myself wanting to go back to education - this led to me completing my undergraduate degree in Finance at Henley Business School. Over this time I really got into finance and started to figure out where my interests and skillset could lie within the industry. I have completed a number of internships which can be seen detailed in my CV section. This interest in finance and the idustry sparked my desire to study at LBS to gain a deeper knowledge in areas that I am truly interested in.
