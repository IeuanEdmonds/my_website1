Back in 2019 my boyfriend, Alex (British/Greek), was studying in Athens for a term so I took the opportunity to spend time in the city and explore as much as possible.

From being a tourist up at the Acropolis:
```{r,cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/temple.jpg", error = FALSE)
```


To spending time in museums:
```{r,cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/museum.jpg", error = FALSE)
```


We even went to "the most famous" (a Greek firend, 2018) bouzoukia:
```{r,cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/bouzoukia.jpg", error = FALSE)
```


And of course, ate thousands of gyros and stuffed vines:
```{r,cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/gyros.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

```{r,cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/vines.jpg", error = FALSE)
```
