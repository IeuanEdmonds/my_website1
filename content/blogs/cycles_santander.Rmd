I gathered the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


Due to the COVID pandemic, most areas were locked down, restricting the outdoor activities for many citizens. Therefore, the demand for hired bikes (sample sizes) decreases for May 2020 and June 2020. However, we observed more extreme values (>= 60K) compared to the previous years. One possible explanation is that due to the social distancing rules, people who have mandatory need of commuting have to choose a safer transportation mean. Therefore, a large number of people are shifting from using public transport like railway to bikes.
However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r,out.width="100%"}
monthly_bike_total <- bike %>%
  filter(year >= 2016, year <= 2019) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(average_bikes = mean(bikes_hired))

monthly_bike_by_year <- bike %>%
  filter(year >= 2016, year <= 2021) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarize(average_bikes = mean(bikes_hired))

monthly_bike_by_year$total_average = monthly_bike_total$average_bikes[match(monthly_bike_by_year$month, monthly_bike_total$month)]

monthly_bike_by_year <- monthly_bike_by_year %>%
  mutate(upper_bar = ifelse(average_bikes > total_average, average_bikes - total_average, 0), lower_bar = ifelse(average_bikes < total_average, total_average - average_bikes, 0))

ggplot(monthly_bike_by_year, aes(x = month)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = total_average, ymax = total_average + upper_bar), 
              fill = "green", alpha = 0.2, group = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = total_average - lower_bar, ymax = total_average), 
              fill = "red", alpha = 0.2, group = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = average_bikes), color = "black",alpha=0.3, group = 1, size = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_average), color = "blue", group = 1, size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016 and 2019",
       y = "Bike rentals",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  NULL
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).
```{r}
weekly_bike_total <- bike %>%
  filter(year >= 2016, year <= 2019) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize(average_bikes = mean(bikes_hired))

weekly_bike_by_year <- bike %>%
  filter(year >= 2016, year <= 2021) %>%
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  summarize(average_bikes = mean(bikes_hired))

weekly_bike_by_year$total_average = weekly_bike_total$average_bikes[match(weekly_bike_by_year$week, weekly_bike_total$week)]

weekly_bike_by_year <- weekly_bike_by_year %>%
  mutate(upper_pct = ifelse(average_bikes > total_average, ((average_bikes / total_average) - 1), 0), lower_pct = ifelse(average_bikes < total_average, ((total_average / average_bikes) - 1), 0))

ggplot(weekly_bike_by_year, aes(x = week)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = 0 + upper_pct), 
              fill = "green", alpha = 0.2, group = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0 - lower_pct, ymax = 0), 
              fill = "red", alpha = 0.2, group = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = upper_pct), color = "black", alpha = 0.3, group = 1, size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = -lower_pct), color = "black", alpha = 0.3, group = 1, size = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  labs(title = "Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from Weekly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016 and 2019",
       y = " ",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store") +
  geom_rug(sides="b",alpha = 1/2, color=ifelse(weekly_bike_by_year$average_bikes > weekly_bike_by_year$total_average, "green", "red"))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  annotate("rect", xmin = 14, xmax = 26, ymin = -1, ymax = 1, fill = "grey", alpha=0.3) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 40, xmax = 52,ymin = -1, ymax = 1, fill = "grey",alpha=0.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(13,26,39,53))
  NULL
