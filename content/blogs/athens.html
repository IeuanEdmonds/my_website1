<p>Back in 2019 my boyfriend, Alex (British/Greek), was studying in Athens for a term so I took the opportunity to spend time in the city and explore as much as possible.</p>
<p>From being a tourist up at the Acropolis:

<p>We even went to “the most famous” (a Greek firend, 2018) bouzoukia:

<p>And of course, ate thousands of gyros and stuffed vines:
